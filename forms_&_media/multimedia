Audio

The audio element allows you to add an audio player to the page.
The audio file is specified using the src attribute:

<audio src="audio.mp3">
   Audio not supported
</audio>

The text between the audio tag is displayed when audio is not supported, for example, when using older browsers.




Controls
The controls attribute displays the player controls:

<audio src="audio.mp3" controls>
  Audio not supported
</audio>

Now when running the code, the browser will display an audio player playing the given track.




Looping
The loop attribute makes the player automatically start to play the track when it reaches the end.

<audio src="audio.mp3" controls [b]loop[/b]>
  Audio not supported
</audio>

here is also an autoplay attribute that makes the audio start playing automatically, however, most browsers disable this feature as it is annoying to most users.




Multiple Sources
Different browsers support different formats of audio. To maximize compatibility, the audio element allows to add different formats of the same audio track using the <source> element:

<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>

Now, if the browser is not able to play the first source, it will attempt to play the second one.



Video
Playing video is very similar to the audio element:

<video controls>
 <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
 <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
 Video is not supported by your browser
</video>

As you can see, the video element supports the same syntax and the same attributes (controls, autoplay, loop), as the audio element.

You can specify the height and width of the video player:

<video controls width="480px" height="300px">
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Video is not supported by your browser
</video>

Irrespective of the size defined, the video will maintain its aspect ratio.




Embed YouTube Videos
Another way to embed videos to a page is using the <iframe> element.

For example, to embed a YouTube video, find a video you like, click the Share button below the video and select the Embed button.

This will give you a code with an <iframe> element, like this:

<iframe width="560" height="315" 
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8kT5c_4PAc" 
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
