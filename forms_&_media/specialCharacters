In HTML, the characters <, >, ", ' and & are special characters, and are parts of the HTML syntax itself.
To include special characters in text, we need to use character references.

These are special codes that represent characters; they start with an ampersand (&), and end with a semicolon (;).
The < sign is represented using & lt; while > is represented by & gt;

<p> A paragraph is created using the & lt;p& gt; tag </p>

Another commonly used character in HTML is the non-breaking space.
It is a space that will not break into a new line and is created using & nbsp;
Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together.
For example:

<b>Speed:</b> 42&nbsp;mph

Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.
If you write 5 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 4 of them, but if you use 10 non-breaking spaces, all of them will be preserved.
