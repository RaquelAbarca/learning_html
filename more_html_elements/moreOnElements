Empty Elements

Similar to <img>, there are other empty elements that are created with a single opening tag.
The <hr> element is used to create a horizontal line:

<p>This is some text</p>
<hr>
<p>This is another text</p>

The <hr> element represents a thematic break between paragraph elements.



The <br> element creates a line break in a paragraph.

<p>
  A <br>
  B <br>
  C <br>
</p>

Without the <br> elements, the paragraph would just be rendered in one line.




There are two important categories of elements in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.

Block-level elements form a visible block on a page
and appear on a new line.

For example, each paragraph element appears from a new line:

<p>hello</p>
<p>this is some text</p>
<p>this is another text</p>

Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers.

Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and represent only small parts of the page.
For example, <a>, <b>, <strong> and similar elements are inline elements:

<p>
  A <b>link</b> to my <a href="https://www.sololearn.com">website</a>
