There are two types of lists in HTML: ordered and unordered.

An unordered list is created using the <ul> tag, is made of items marked with bullets.

Each list item is created using the <li> tag. 
Here is an example list of shopping items:

<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
</ul>

the items are put between the <ul></ul> tags.

An ordered list uses numbers instead of bullets for the items.
It is created similar to the unordered list, and uses the <ol> tag instead of <ul> to wrap the items:

<ol>
  <li>Bob</li>
  <li>Amy</li>
  <li>Dave</li>
</ol>


Lists can be nested inside other lists.

<ol>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Apples
    <ul>
      <li>Red</li>
      <li>Green</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
</ol>
