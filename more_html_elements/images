<img src="tree.jpg" >
The src attribute specifies the address of the image we want to embed.


The alt attribute is used to specify text, which will display if the image fails to load.
<img src="tree.jpg" alt="A Tree" >
The alt text acts as a description for the image.
It is used in screen readers, as well as search engines, as the description of the image

The alt attribute is required for a valid HTML markup.
In case when your image is just for decoration, you can use a blank alt value:
<img src="tree.jpg" alt="" >

You can also specify a custom size for the image using the height and width attributes:
<img src="tree.jpg" alt="A Tree" width="200px" >
If only one dimension is specified, the other will adjust according to the aspect ratio of the image.
It can also take percentage values.
