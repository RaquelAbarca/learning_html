Nesting
Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. 
For example, we can have a bold word in a paragraph:

<p><b>HTML</b> is fun</p>

As you can see, the <b> element is nested inside a <p> element.



Page Structure

An HTML page is a combination of multiple nested elements.
A basic HTML page has the following structure:

<html>
   <body>
   </body>
</html>

The <html> tag defines the page, while the <body> tag defines the main content  and contains all the elements of the page, such as paragraphs, tables, lists, etc.

<html>
   <body>
   <p>
   </p>
   </body>
</html>

<body> is a child of <html>, while <p> is a child of <body>.

The element which includes other elements is called their parent. So, <body> is the parent of the <p> element.
