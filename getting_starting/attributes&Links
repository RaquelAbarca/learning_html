Tags can have attributes, which contain additional information about the element.
For example, the align attribute specifies the alignment of a paragraph:

<p align="center">some text</p>

Attributes have the syntax name="value", where name is the attribute name, and value is the corresponding value.
The attributes are defined in the opening tag:

<p align="right">hello</p>

The name of the attribute should be followed by an equal sign.


Attributes are used for creating hyperlinks.

<a href="https://www.sololearn.com">Click here</a>

The <a> tag makes the enclosed text a hyperlink.
The href attribute specifies the address of the link.


An element can have multiple attributes.
<a href="https://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank" title="Sololearn">Click here</a>
The target attribute specifies how to open the link. 
With the value "_blank", it will open in a new tab.
The title attribute specifies the text to appear when the cursor is over the link.
